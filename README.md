## Hypothetical Case  
A mid-scale restaurant in Tahlequah called The Willow Tree utilizes a website-based Order Management System (OMS) that allows customers to place orders at their table using a kiosk. However, the OMS has been facing intermittent performance and security issues due to the software's website-based deployment. Therefore, the OMS requires an overhaul to improve its performance and better secure data.  
<br>
To address the issue, restaurant owner Maria Zabala has approached Code-Logik, a local software development firm, to discuss a redesign solution.  
<br>
The following documentation will treat the hypothetical case as a real-life business interaction.

## Project Proposal  
![Code-Logik Logo](docs/assets/project_proposal_logo.png)
**PROJECT NAME:** The Willow Tree OMS  
**PROJECT REFERENCE:** CS4233 CAPSTONE PROJECT 2024  
**DATE:** 23 JAN 2024  

The Willow Tree’s current Order Management System (OMS) allows customers to place orders at the table via a kiosk.  

Although the current release is functional, the OMS has been facing intermittent performance and security issues due to its software's website-based deployment. A redesign is necessary to improve the performance and better secure data.  

The current OMS software performance is impacted by circumstances extending beyond The Willow Tree’s scope of business; the hosted source code is also vulnerable to random and targeted security threats and requires a redesign to protect the integrity of The Willow Tree’s day-to-day operations.  

Code-Logik proposes rebuilding the OMS into a desktop application to accommodate the highly interactive usage expected in a restaurant setting. Having the OMS deployed as a desktop application will improve stability and overall performance and reduce the possible footholds available to potential security threats.  

The proposal aims to deliver The Willow Tree a secure, stable, high-performance OMS capable of keeping pace with restaurant business demands while providing the customer with the best possible dining experience.  

Code-Logik estimates that it will take approximately 13 weeks to complete the redesign of The Willow Tree OMS.

This project aims to redesign the Order Management System from a website-based into a desktop-based application. The current OMS is functional; however, the customers' dining experience continues to suffer with intermittent performance and security issues. Code-Logik will redesign the OMS into a secure, stable, high-performance application that will undoubtedly provide The Willow Tree’s customers with the best possible dining experience.
